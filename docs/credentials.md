# FCM Credentials Documentation

> To be able to use an instance of the bot properly, you want to setup your FCM Credentials. Adding these credentials makes it possible for you to pair with servers as well as connecting to them.

## Retrieving FCM Credentials

* Download and install the [rustplusplus FCM Credential Application](https://github.com/alexemanuelol/rustplusplus-Credential-Application/releases/download/v1.1.0/rustPlusPlus-1.1.0-win-x64.exe)
* Once downloaded and installed, open it and press the button `Connect with Rust+`.

* Click `Copy` to copy the Slash Command.

* Paste the Slash command in your Discord Server Text Channel. Which Text Channel you run the Slash Command is not important, as long as the bot has access to it.

* This process is the same for the owner of the bot as well as any teammate that want to register their credentials (mainly for the purpose to extend the usage of the leader command). Once a teammate have registered their credentials, they just need to go inside the game and pair with the server. Which teammates that have paired with the server can be seen in the information channel, they should have the P icon beside their name, see below:

## Why is FCM Credentials necessary?

FCM Credentials are necessary in order to get the following:

* Server Pairing Notifications
* Smart Devices Pairing Notifications
* Smart Alarm Notifications
* Player Offline Death Notifications
* Teammate Login Notifications
* Facepunch News

Without these, the bot would not operate properly.
