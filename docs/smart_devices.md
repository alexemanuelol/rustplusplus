# Smart Devices

> Smart Devices is an umbrella term for three different devices, `Smart Switches`, `Smart Alarms` and `Storage Monitors`. To pair a Smart Device with rustplusplus, make sure you've [setup the FCM-Credentials](credentials.md). When the FCM-Credentials are setup, you just need a `wire tool` and start pairing like you would with the [Rust+ Companion App](https://rust.facepunch.com/companion). Once you've paired your Smart Devices, they should appear in their respective Discord Text-Channel (`switches`, `alarms` or `storagemonitors`).
<br>

It is possible to change the display image for all the different Smart Devices by running the corresponding Slash Command. The Slash Commands to change Smart Device images is `/switch`, `/alarm` and `/storagemonitor`.


## Smart Switches
> Paired Smart Switches can be located in the `switches` Text-Channel on Discord. Only Smart Switches from the currently/last connected Rust server will be shown in the channel.

The image above is what a paired Smart Switch looks like in Discord. In this case the Smart Switch is called `Switch` and is located at E16. All Smart Devices have an Entity Id which is used to identify it. The Custom Command for this switch is `!sw` which can be used from the in-game teamchat.
<br><br>
The Smart Switch can be turned ON/OFF by clicking the `TURN ON` / `TURN OFF` button at the bottom. By clicking on the `EDIT` button, you can edit things such as the `Name` and the `Custom Command` for the Smart Switch. If the `AUTO SETTING` is set to either `AUTO-ON-PROXIMITY` or `AUTO-OFF-PROXIMITY`, there will be a proximity setting available to edit. The proximity setting is used to turn the switch ON/OFF when a teammate is within the proximity of the Smart Switch. To remove the Smart Switch, just click the trashcan button.

The images above is what paired Storage Monitors looks like in Discord. There are three types of Storage Monitors depending on where you place them. The first one is of type `Tool Cupboard` and works almost like the second and third type `Large Wood Box` and `Vending Machine` but with the difference that it shows upkeep. In both cases the `Name` of the Storage Monitors is `Storage Monitor` and can be located at E16. All Smart Devices have an Entity Id which is used to identify it.

## Unreachable Smart Devices
> When a Smart Devices gets removed, the hoster loses building privilege to the Smart Device or rustplusplus just don't get a response from pinging it, the device is unreachable. In the image below you can see the Smart Switch `Switch` can no longer be reached. In this case its because of a force wipe, The Smart Switch does no longer exist. If the Smart Device is unreachable because the hoster lost building privilege, gaining building privilege again will make the device reachable again. But if the Smart Device was removed from where it was placed you might as well remove it from Discord, once a Smart Device gets removed the Entity Id is invalid. Even if you place the same Smart Device, the Entity Id will be different.
